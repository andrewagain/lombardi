# LOMBARDI Case-making

Next step is to re-envision the app as a 'case maker'.
The flow I've got so far is:

1. SOURCE COLLECTION
* put in a keyword
* choose relevant articles
* optionally crawl for more
* optionally manually enter more (and you can do this at any point later)
[At this point you have a list of sources, each with a summary]


2. CONFLICT COLLECTION
* Make a list of the points of disagreement amongst these articles.
* Anywhere an article makes a point, also include the opposite opinion, even if it is not expressed anywhere. (In other words, every point has on opposite)


3. CASE MAKING

3.1 CASE NAME
* Select one of the conflicts, and then pick a side. (Or just type in the exact wording of the case you want to make)

3.2 CASE CLARIFICATION
* Select the key terms that you would like to be extremely clear on.
* Select a definition for each of these terms (or enter/modify one to make it your own) e.g. "patriarchy" or "gain of function"
* Write your optional 'anti-case', expressing any related cases that you are NOT attempting to convince people of. (For instance, making the case for a lab leak, vs. making the case for a lab leak of specifically a genetically modified organism.

3.3 CASE TEXT
Description of why the given supporting arguments tie together to make your case.
( Limit to 5000 chars - the burden of clear communication is on the writer, not the reader )

3.3 CASE SUPPORT
* Create a list of 'supporting evidence items'.
* Each supporting evidence item:
  - Has a name
  - Has an optional list of sources
     - Including possibly one or more cases, which are displayed in a special format

3.4 CASE COUNTERS
* Create a list of possible counter-arguments
* For each counter-argument, create a 'supporting evidence item' just like above, which expresses why that counter argument is not a big deal, or explains why you still make your case despite this counter-evidence.

3.5 CASE CONCLUSION
* Optional text to explain and tie up the case.


3.5 SUBCASES
* For each supporting evidence

3.6 PUBLISH
Publish the case, which freezes it at a particular version and makes it public for comment.


4. FEEDBACK

4.1 Share the case on social media
    All cases will also be in a list on the lombardi home page.

4.2 Users Provide Feedback
    Requests for clarification in any part of the case
    Agree/Disagree
    Disagreement Requires Deciding:
       - Not enough supporting evidence
       - A listed counter argument is too strong (select the specific counter case)
       - Another case conflicts, and is stronger (link the case)
       - Conclusion does not follow from supporting evidence.
       - Issue with a specific source: not trustworthy, incorrect based on another case that refutes it, etc.

Users cannot see the feedback collected by other users until after they are done with their entry, to avoid bias.



5. REFINE CASE

Repeat steps 3 and 4 as often as desired, refining your case to the point where it is irrefutable and can begin to spread into the minds of everyone everywhere as a fact that can be accepted and put to rest... at least until new information comes to light.


6. (LATER)
* Graph of connected cases and sources
* Notifications when a case that you have accepted becomes invalided by the author, or if people who previously accepted it no longer do, or if someone adds new counters to that case, etc. etc.
