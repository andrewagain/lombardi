# Scholarly Rot

This story is about a harvard scholar who lied in a bunch of research:

My theory is that many many more professors are doing this. Why wouldn't they? Nobody pays attention to their research except their circle-jerking colleagues. It sounds like universities are more social clubs for elite undeserving professors to toot their own horns.


## Study citation graph

For each study, use AI to check if:
* The study relies upon other studies which must be valid in order for this study to be valid (call these 'assumed true' studies)
* Use AI to determine other edge types 
* Chart the studies along with potential issue flags
* See if you can find any connections while navigating through the data

Any authors with repeated red flags in their papers?
Any heavily-cited papers with many red flags?
How about papers that are still being cited recently on twitter despite being invalid?

## Scholar Rot Report

Lets see if I can make any statistical determinations on how many institutional scholars are full of shit.

In other words: clear out the rot from science. Call for specific shitty professors at major universities to be tanked so that the country can get back to trusting science again.

Ideally, see if entire fields of study can be eliminated because they are total nonsense.

Also - see which predominant narratives are based on bad scientific studies.


## Notes

find papers that make assumptions which are absurd
find papers that make assumptions which are large and unstated
focus on harvard and other ivy league institutions
