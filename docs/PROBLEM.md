# Problem

Top Reasons that people miscommunicate / misunderstand each other:


1. Emotions: Attachment to a particular point. Raising voices or speaking quickly or becoming anxious and forgetting. Defensiveness etc.

2. Mismatched word definitions: They are using a word differently / they each have a different definition in their head as they are speaking. (e.g. "patriarchy")

3. Mismatched sentence/phrase meanings: Often one speaker does not understand why the other is upset with them, or they think it is for one reason when it is in fact another.
